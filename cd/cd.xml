						  specified to the <file> elements (optional, take note that it does not behave
						  like cd or chdir and must be a complete path, can be a relative or absolute path).

			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to avoid
				the possibility of 'drive runaway' which can damage a drive mechanism.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely which ensures a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed on a file browser.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).
